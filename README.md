# competitive-programming (My Competitive Programming Repository)
A repository to store and backup all my code for competitive programming stuffs.

### Motivation
I had my exposure to Competitive Programming during the first year of my high school. Even though I didn't have any significant achievement on Competitive Programming due to my lack of dedication and consistency, I can say that Competitive Programming is something that helps me to shape into who I am right now.
Even though I know that I'm still a "noob" competitive programmer, I realize that through competitive programming, one's always push and strive to become better programmer.
