### Motivation
I had exposure to Competitive Programming during the first year of my high school. Even though I didn't have any significant achievement on Competitive Programming due to my lack of dedication and consistency, I can say that Competitive Programming is the one who shaped me into who I am right now.
Even though I'm a "noob" competitive programmer, I realize that through competitive programming, one's always push and strive to become better programmer.
